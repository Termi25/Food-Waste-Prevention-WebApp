# TW-Project
Food Waste Prevention App

# Goal
To develop a web app that allows users to share food they no longer consume

# Description
The app makes users more aware about food waste in a fun way and based on community sharing

# Functionalities
1. As a user I can make a list organized by categories with the product available in my fridge

2. As a user I get notified when a product reaches the valability term. The app allows me to mark products as available to be shared

3. As a user I can define groups of friends and label according to their food preferences. I can invite friends to see the list of available products.

4. Any user can claim products in my list

5. The app allows sharing on social media platforms


# How to launch it
The web app makes use of REACT.JS and Express.JS with 2 dedicated servers, one for front end and one for backend.

Each server can be started after running npm i --force in /gui and /server, after which they can be started using npm start. Both apps run on localhost.
This app was tested using Visual Studio Code.
